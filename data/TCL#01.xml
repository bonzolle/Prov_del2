Progenitor virus (shiso uirusu?) is a family of RNA viruses. Progenitor is immensely ancient, and is suspected of being hundreds of millions if not billions of years old, and is considered to have both aided and hindered evolution of Earth's ecology through the extremities of its resulting mutations.
While otherwise behaving as a typical Group VI virus in the Baltimore classification, Progenitor is distinct from all other viruses by being able to reverse lysis in cells and revive organisms dead for considerable lengths of time. Whereas other retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, will target particular cells of a particular animal's body, Progenitor is capable of infecting the cells of any organism, whether animal, fungal, plant or bacterial.
Considerable research on Progenitor has been undertaken since its discovery in the late 1960s, and a number of engineered strains have since come into existence primarily for bioweapons research.
