Tyrant Virus, otherwise known as the t-Virus, is the general name given to a series of mutant Progenitor virus strains.
Initially developed by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals in the late 1960s, the primary goal of the "t-Virus Project" was to effectively eliminate the need for a large-scale conventional army and generate revenue to go to their eugenics program, the Wesker Project. This required two things: the virus had to be highly-contagious to the point of infecting an entire target population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate.[1][2] Such a virus was impossible due to such contagions' tendencies to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread.
