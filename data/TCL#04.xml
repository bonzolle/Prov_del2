Uroboros is an RNA virus in the Progenitor family. Engineered in the 21st century by Dr. Albert Wesker as the ultimate eugenics tool, a less potent strain was later developed by Dr. Alex Wesker to serve as a bio-weapon. There is currently no known vaccine for either strain of Uroboros. The virus' name is derived from the Ouroboros in Greek mythology, a snake or snake-like creature which consumed itself.
