The Chrysalid Virus, abbreviated as C-Virus, is a family of viruses that were created by The Family as a next-generation bio-weapon. With a genome containing genes from t-Veronica and Golgotha Virus, the C-Virus was able to both preserve some degree of intelligence in mutants and revive the dead and induce violent mutations in hosts. A vaccine was created in 2013, ending its reliability as a weapon.
