Plagas (purāga?) are a genus of parasitic arthropod belonging to an unknown taxonomical order. They are endemic to a remote mountainous region of Spain from whence they get their name; from the Spanish words "las plagas", meaning "the plagues".
Assuming Plagas are otherwise typical parasitic arthropods, they are believed to asexually reproduce, with their eggs being expelled from the host and consumed by other animals as part of their life-cycle. Plagas typically reach maturity within days of hatching, and following the larval stage grow through three stages dubbed "A", "B" and "C". Plagas are able to influence their host's actions by latching onto the nervous system, increasing aggression in human hosts, dubbed Ganados, as well forming a social cluster with other hosts. Unless the host's brain were destroyed, this influence is not total, allowing hosts to continue with their daily routines.
All Plagas living in the 21st century are descended from either of two species, one artificial, employed by the paramilitary cult Los Iluminados as part of its bioweapons project.
