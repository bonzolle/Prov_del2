The Animality Virus, or simply the A-Virus, is a genus of Progenitor virus which was engineered as a bioweapon by a research team led by former CIA agent Glenn Arias.[1] The A-Virus was the cause of a disease similar to that of the t-Virus caused Cannibal Disease, wherein infected humans - dubbed "Zombies" - experience violent tendencies, increased hunger to the point of cannibalism, and deterioration of cognitive function. What set this viral disease apart from many other progenitor derived strains was the slower rate of cognitive deterioration, resulting in Zombies capable of a degree of speech and coordination. The virus was also noted to be highly flammable a trait it seemingly also passed on to those infected with it.
